# Quant_Prob_Paleo
Course materials for Quantitative Problems in Paleoecology taught at the University of South Florida

The goal of this course is to gain experience using command-line tools to explore the unique challenges of reconstructing past environmental change from sedimentary records. This repository holds the weekly coding assignments and core datasets employed in the course.

Module 1: What happened?

Coding challenge: Describe distributions of data from GoM dredge survey. Model distributions under different sampling and environmental constraints.

Week 1: Course introduction, first principles, and getting started in R
Week 2: Proxies, sampling, and distributions.
Week 3: Variance, co-variance, and regression
Week 4: Matrix math and dissimilarity
Week 5: Exploratory analyses - factor analysis, PCA, DCA.

Module 2: When did it happen?

Coding challenge: Conduct evaluations of changes in diversity of GoM dredge samples based on taphonomic grades. Develop models of continuous change from which plausible results might be derived.

Week 6: Live-Dead differences
Week 7: Age-depth modeling
Week 8: Rate of Change analysis
Week 9: Generalize additive modeling

Module 3: Where did it happen?

Coding challenge: Develop spatial representations of GoM analyses so far and extrapolate changes based on environmental data.

Week 10: Proxy development and spatial extrapolation
Week 11: Spatial auto-correlation and model calibration
Week 12: Monte-Carlo simulations
Week 13: Quantifying spatial data

Module 4: Causality and Hypothesis Testing

Coding challenge: Create null models of plausible outcomes and test against empirically derived data.

Week 14: Predictive modeling
Week 15: Model evaluation and calibration
